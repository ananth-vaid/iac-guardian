+# Reduce payment-api replicas to save costs
+
+## Changes
+- Scale down `payment-api` from 20 → 5 replicas
+- Estimated savings: ~$600/month in compute costs
+
+## Rationale
+Current utilization shows we're over-provisioned. Reducing to 5 replicas should be sufficient for typical load.
+
+## Testing
+- [ ] Verified in staging environment
+- [ ] Load testing pending
+
+---
+
+**Expected IaC Guardian Analysis:**
+This PR should trigger a HIGH RISK warning because:
+1. Last Tuesday (Feb 11) at 2pm, we needed 18 replicas at 85% CPU to handle 82k req/min
+2. 5 replicas cannot handle peak traffic (would be 306% CPU)
+3. Recent incident (INC-4521) was caused by similar capacity issue
