++# Reduce payment-api replicas to save costs
++
++## Changes
++- Scale down `payment-api` from 20 → 5 replicas
++- Estimated savings: ~$600/month in compute costs
++
++## Rationale
++Current utilization shows we're over-provisioned. Reducing to 5 replicas should be sufficient for typical load.
++
++## Testing
++- [ ] Verified in staging environment
++- [ ] Load testing pending
++
++---
++
++**Expected IaC Guardian Analysis:**
++This PR should trigger a HIGH RISK warning because:
++1. Last Tuesday (Feb 11) at 2pm, we needed 18 replicas at 85% CPU to handle 82k req/min
++2. 5 replicas cannot handle peak traffic (would be 306% CPU)
++3. Recent incident (INC-4521) was caused by similar capacity issue

+# Scale up data processing cluster
+
+## Changes
+- Increase `data_processor` instances: 5 → 10
+- Upgrade instance type: `c5.2xlarge` → `c5.4xlarge`
+
+## Rationale
+Preparing for Q1 data pipeline expansion. Need more processing capacity for new analytics workloads.
+
+## Cost Impact
+- Current: 5x c5.2xlarge = ~$1,680/month
+- New: 10x c5.4xlarge = ~$6,720/month
+- Increase: +$5,040/month
+
+---
+
+**Expected IaC Guardian Analysis:**
+This PR should trigger COST OPTIMIZATION warning because:
+1. Datadog shows current 5 instances run at 15% CPU utilization
+2. Over-provisioning by ~3x for the stated workload
+3. Recommendation: Use 4x c5.2xlarge instead (same capacity, saves $3k/month)
